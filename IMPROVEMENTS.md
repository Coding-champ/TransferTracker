# Network Visualization Improvements

## Major Changes

1. **Completely restructured component architecture**:
   - Created a modular organization similar to FilterPanel
   - Separated concerns into specialized hooks and utility functions
   - Better code organization and maintainability

2. **Fixed simulation control issues**:
   - Added explicit start/stop/pause functionality
   - Fixed the problem of nodes moving without user interaction
   - Implemented better cooling of the simulation

3. **Enhanced interaction handling**:
   - Fixed zoom and drag functionality conflicts
   - Better handling of drag vs. click detection
   - Clear separation between drag state and selection state

4. **Improved zoom behavior**:
   - Fixed zoom issues with proper event handling
   - Added visual feedback for different zoom levels
   - Prevented wheel events from interfering with page scrolling

5. **Added node pinning functionality**:
   - Users can now pin/unpin nodes with visual indicators
   - Fixed nodes stay in place while unpinned nodes still move

## Code Improvements

1. **Decoupled hooks**:
   - `useSimulationControl` - manages the D3 force simulation
   - `useZoomControls` - handles zoom behavior
   - `useNetworkInteractions` - manages user interactions

2. **Utility modules**:
   - `nodeUtils.ts` - functions for creating and updating nodes
   - `edgeUtils.ts` - functions for creating and updating edges

3. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Better event throttling
   - Conditional rendering based on zoom level
   - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added explicit network controls
   - Improved information displays for nodes and edges
   - Better visual feedback for interactions

## Usage Example

The NetworkVisualization component now has a cleaner API:

```jsx
import NetworkVisualization from './components/NetworkVisualization';

function App() {
  return (
    <NetworkVisualization 
      networkData={myData}
      height={600}
      onNodeSelect={(nodeId) => console.log(`Selected node: ${nodeId}`)}
      onEdgeSelect={(edgeId) => console.log(`Selected edge: ${edgeId}`)}
    />
  );
}
